### Library App

The library app calls the OpenLibrary API based on the search terms the user inputs. There is form validation to ensure the user has input a long enough search term. A loading spinner shows while the API is making the call. Only 10 books are displayed with a load more button to load more books. Books can be favourited with all favourited books shown on a separate page.

To do list of improvements:
- Make app responsive.
- Write tests for the app.
- Build more features (a login page, book rating, book commenting)
